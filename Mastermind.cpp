/* Mastermind by Lewis Lam, CHristophyer Ly, Derrick Lee
* Code based off of Michael Burdick
* This is an extremely simple version of the popular game Mastermind, which involves the computer randomly generating a series of four "pegs", all either Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, or Purple.
* The user then gets an alloted number of guesses to try and guess the series, referred to as the code. The only feedback the user recieves is two numbers: the number
* of pegs they have perfectly correct, and the number of pegs that are the right color, but in the wrong spot.
